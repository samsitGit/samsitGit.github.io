#### Linda Kozma-Spytek
* Mentor
* she/her
Linda Kozma-Spytek is Senior Research Audiologist in the
Technology Access Program of Gallaudet University. She
also co-directs the Deaf and Hard of Hearing Technology
Rehabilitation Engineering Research Center at Gallaudet
University, funded by the National Institute on Disability,
Independent Living and Rehabilitation Research. Her 
research includes investigating the use of Internet Protocol-
Captioned Telephone Service (IP-CTS), the compatibility of

digital cellular telephones and hearing aids and the
accessibility of VoIP telephony applications for individuals

Norman Williams is the senior research engineer for
Technology Access Program. He is deaf and has an AAS
degree from the National Technical Institute for the Deaf
in Electro-Mechanical Technology, and a BA from
Gallaudet University in Computer Science. He has an
extensive background in telecommunications used by
people who are deaf. He wrote various text/video
applications and for servers, including the popular TTY
software for PCs known as Futura-TTY. He wrote a white
paper for Federal agencies to use firewall information
for videophones independently from outside companies.
He invented and patented a new way to communicate in
AIM called Real Time Text with IM preview used by AOL
and AT&T Relay. He lead an ASCII standard effort for
interoperability between TTYs with an ASCII option. He
also has explored video communication technologies and
worked with various companies such as ISDN, Internet,
and phone based video calls before video relay service
started. Williams worked as a Research Engineer in CSD.
He did some software engineering and some hardware
research for the video relay service. Recent projects at
Gallaudet are: developed WebRTC with Real Time Text
on each video chat, VRS interoperable tests, developed
sharp flashing for smart lights for sleepers and bright
environments and developed to experiment on new ways
of show captions in web videos.

#### Katja Jacobs
* Graduate Mentor
* she/her
Hi everyone! My name is Katja and I’m from Seattle,
Washington. Since graduating from the University of
Washington with a degree in Medical Anthropology and
Global Health last March, I’ve been researching health
disparities and quality of life in the Deaf community as
an intern and research assistant at the Center for Deaf
Health Equity at Gallaudet University. In the fall, I’ll
begin my Master of Public Health at Boston University.
With a concentration in Community Assessment, Program
Design, Implementation, and Evaluation, as well as
Global Health, I hope to work with marginalized
communities and to expand consideration for deaf
populations in the field of public health.
