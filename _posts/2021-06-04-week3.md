title: Week 3 - 5/31-6/4
---

The first day of the week was a day off to honor the dead U.S. soldiers. As soon as that day was over, we started focusing on completing the slides for the literature review and literature review itself as a setup for our research paper's introduction portion. The week went by quickly and slowly working on just that.

We practiced presenting the slides and presented. It went incredibly well! We got a tremendous amount of positive feedbacks and comments. We continued to work toward completing the literature review by adding more history and background and another context for our research.

One of the team also started on having a mock study so I went to get "interviewed", which feels very similar to other researches I've participated in in RIT. So I think I have a good idea of what an interview process would look like now. I also thought of a lot of ideas for doing the research but not quite sure which to implement. Perhaps it would be clear as I continue to accumulate knowledge and experience.
